# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** January 24, 2026

PrayerFirst ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the PrayerFirst mobile app (the "App") collects, uses, and shares information.

## Information We Collect

### Information you provide

- **Profile name** (optional) and any **journal entries** or notes you enter in the App.
- **Prayer schedules, streaks, and preferences** you configure in the App.

### Information collected automatically

- **Device and subscription information** needed to provide and restore purchases. We use **RevenueCat** and **Apple** to process subscriptions, which may provide us with non‑identifying purchase and entitlement data (for example, active subscription status and expiration dates).

### Notifications

- The App requests notification permissions to send reminders. We do **not** collect or store push tokens on our servers.

### Local storage

- Most app data (journal entries, streaks, schedules, settings) is stored **locally on your device** using on‑device storage. If you delete the App, this data is removed from your device.

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Provide core App functionality (prayer reminders, streaks, schedules, and settings).
- Enable subscriptions and restore purchases.
- Respond to support requests.

## Sharing of Information

We do **not** sell your personal information. We share limited information with:

- **Apple** (for in‑app purchases and subscriptions).
- **RevenueCat** (to manage subscriptions and entitlements).
- **Service providers** that help operate the App (if any). These providers are bound to process data only for service delivery.

## Data Retention

We retain subscription data as required to provide service and comply with legal obligations. Local device data remains on your device unless you delete it or uninstall the App.

## Your Choices

- You can disable notifications in iOS Settings.
- You can delete local data by uninstalling the App.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy and change the effective date.
